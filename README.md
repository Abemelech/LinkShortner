# LinkShortner
### Created on Java 16
LinkShortner is a small side project that converts links to a shortned form of said link.

**Example**: google.com would change to AM.com/sdkfjg 

The program is a console program and the links aren't hosted online and won't redirect it by using the link on a browser.

However, you will be able to put the link into the console of the program following the menu to get access to the website.
